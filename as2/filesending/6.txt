Hannibal smiles, and holds his arms out to her when she's done tying her hair up, wisps flying wayward around her face, the rest in a bun at her neck. She goes to him eagerly, her head tucked neatly under his chin as he hugs her tightly. Even from here, Will can hear his purr. It's important for them, as Alpha and female, to re-cement their bond after every fight with physical affection. Although Shannon can't hear his purr as intimately as Will and Adam can, she still feels it in his chest when he does it.

Adam huffs, clucking his tongue at the side of his mouth. "When do I get to start fighting?" he asks.

Will laughs, turning his attention back to his son. Except for his darker hair, Adam is the spitting image of Hannibal â€“ a fact he knows pleases the Alpha immensely. He has Hannibal's profile, his eyes, and his build is much like Will imagines Hannibal's was, when he was younger. He certainly lacks Will's slenderness from his youth. He'll grow into a fine Alpha after he presents.
