"One paperclip, two inches long. Three rubber bands – green, yellow, blue. Blue was the thickest. One ballpoint pen, black ink, half-full. One yellow Snapple bottle lid."

"What was the quote inside the lid?"

"Trick question. It was face-up." Will smiles. "One red crayon."

"Which red?"

"I…" Will's eyes meet and hold those of his son, the whiskey-brown of his father's irises blinking back at him. They narrow under a set of dark eyebrows, and Adam huffs, looks down at the cloth-covered tray, and closes his eyes. "I don't remember."

"That's okay," Will replies. "You got everything else right."

Adam shakes his head, runs his fingers through the mop of light brown hair that had fallen across his forehead, and rolls his shoulders forward with another frustrated huff. He straightens and glares down at the tray of items as Will uncovers them again.
