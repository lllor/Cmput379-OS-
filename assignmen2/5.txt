Will observes in silence, his elbows on his knees as he watches Hannibal spar with their daughter. Shannon's round cheeks are flushed with exertion, there's sweat on her forehead and darkening her shirt under her arms and around her neck. Hannibal is sweating, as well â€“ they have been play-fighting most of the morning, well before Adam and Will joined them in the room to for their observation and memory exercises.

Shannon lunges for Hannibal, growling when he grabs her wrist and twists her arm behind her, hauling her arm up to threaten dislocating her shoulder. He wraps his other hand in her hair, jerking her head back, her throat bared. He puts his teeth to her neck in the killing blow and, after a moment, her shoulders go lax and his threat of a bite turns into a kiss at her temple, and he lets her go with a pleased purr.

"You're getting stronger," he tells her, soft with affection.

She blows a lock of hair out of her face, and then gathers her hair to tie it up. "Still lost," she replies, breathing hard, sullen.
